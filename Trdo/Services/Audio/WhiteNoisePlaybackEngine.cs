/// <remarks>
/// Deliberately independent of <see cref="RadioStaticService"/>. That service exists to mask a
/// stream while it buffers, and tells <see cref="AudioSilenceMonitorService"/> to discount its
/// output so a dead stream hiding behind the static still triggers recovery. A white noise
/// station is the opposite: its audio <em>is</em> the content, so it must read to the silence
/// monitor as ordinary output, which is exactly what keeping it off that discount path gives it
/// for free.
/// <para>
/// Unlike the buffering static, this engine keeps its WASAPI render device open across
/// pause/resume rather than tearing it down - a white noise station is meant to run for long,
/// uninterrupted stretches, so paying device re-activation latency on every toggle would be the
/// wrong trade.
